apt -get upgrade

apt -get update

pkg install python

pkg install git

pip install colored

How the Checker Works?
1. Put Combolist (ex. /sdcard/list.txt)
2. When saving the path make sure that there's a text file on that path for (ex. /sdcard/downloads/live.txt)
3. Same as die.txt

Make sure you're combolist is @gmail, @yahoo, @yandex, @hotmail, etc.
