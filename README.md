How the Checker Works?
1. Import Combolist (ex. /sdcard/list.txt) (Make sure to locate your .txt files on where the destination is.)
2. Import Proxies (ex. /sdcard/proxies.txt) (Make sure to locate your .txt files on where the destination is.)
2. When saving the path make sure that there's a text file on that path for (ex. /sdcard/downloads/live.txt) (Make sure to locate your .txt files on where the destination is.)
3. Same as die.txt

Make sure you're combolist is @gmail, @yahoo, @yandex, @hotmail, etc.
